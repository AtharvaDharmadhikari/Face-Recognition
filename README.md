# 📸 Facial Recognition Application

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **Facial Recognition Application** built using:
- **Kivy** for the Graphical User Interface (UI)
- **OpenCV** for computer vision to capture and compare real-time facial data with a stored database
- **Siamese Neural Network (SNN)** for accurate face verification

The system performs real-time face detection, feature extraction, and verification against stored faces with high accuracy and minimal false positives.

## ✨ Features
- **Real-Time Face Capture** – Detects and captures faces from a live camera feed.
- **Face Matching** – Compares captured face embeddings with stored database entries.
- **Deep Learning (Siamese Network)** – Improves verification accuracy and reduces false positives.
- **Interactive UI** – Built with Kivy for a clean and user-friendly experience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Kivy** (UI)
- **OpenCV** (Computer Vision)
- **TensorFlow / Keras** (Deep Learning)
